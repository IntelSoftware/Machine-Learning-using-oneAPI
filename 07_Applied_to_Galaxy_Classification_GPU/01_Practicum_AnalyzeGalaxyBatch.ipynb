    "\n",
    "Using ~5000 labeled stars out of ~80,000 in each galaxy (170,000 stars total), make a model to predict and/or classify all the stars in the collection of the galaxy collision.\n",

    "- Find all neighboring pairs of points in two approaching galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the creation of two synthetically created star locations in Euclidean coordinates. The galaxies are set to collide with each other. Techniques described are an approach to classifying which stars belong to which galaxy after the collision. We also later identify the coordinates of pairs of points that lie within a radius R of each other. Points already lying with radius R in either galaxy are ignored, and the focus is narrowed to points in one galaxy in close proximity to the points in the other galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We synthesize ~ 80,000 stars in each of two galaxies—a fictitious GFFA (\"galaxy far, far away\") and a fictitious \"Xeno\", which is the backdrop for Superman's Krypton. Combined, this is over 100,000 stars, for which we search for neighboring pairs on the order of a few light years apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play the following video which plots and rotates the combined galaxies. It plots a 3D scatter plot of the nearly 200,000 stars in the two galaxies. It gradually reduces the opacity of each star to ultimately reveal the one or two or handfuls of stars that are within a given radius of each other as a result of the collision of the two galaxies. The center bulge in each galaxy is so dense that the red zone stars are not visible until we turn the opacity of the stars down significantly.\n",
