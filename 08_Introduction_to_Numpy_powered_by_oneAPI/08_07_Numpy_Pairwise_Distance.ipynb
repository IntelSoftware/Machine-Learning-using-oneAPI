    "\n",
    "Code that written inefficiently:\n",
    "- Be less readable (less pythonic)\n",
    "- Can consume more time\n",

    "This module will focus on trying to simultaneously make code readable as well as more efficient as measured by how well we accelerate code examples. While the code example themselves are small examples, the techniques described are application in a wide variety of scenarios in AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python loops are bad for performance\n",
    "**Python is great!** Its a great language for AI. There are many, many advantages in using Python especially for data science.\n",
    "- Easy to program (don’t worry about data types and fussy syntax at least relative to C/C++ and other languages\n",
    "- FAST for developing code!\n",
    "- Leverages huge array of libraries to conquer any domain\n",
    "- Lots of quick answers to common issues in Stack Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python, however, is slow for Massively repeating small tasks - such as found in loops! **Python loops are SLOW**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compared to C, C++, Fortran and other typed languages\n",
    "- Python is forced to look up every occurrence and type of variable in a loop to determine what operations it can perform on that data type\n",
    "- It cannot usually take advantage of advances in hardware in terms of vector width increases, multiple cores, new instructions from a new HW instruction set, new AI accelerators, effective cache memory layout, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BUT: Python has library remedies to these ills!\n",
    "- Importing key libraries shift the burden of computation to highly efficient code\n",
    "- NumPy, for example, through its focus on elementwise efficient operations, gives indirect access to the efficiencies afforded in \"C\" \n",
    "- libraries included in oneAPI and NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn all powered by oneAPI give access to modern advancements in hardware level: access to better cache and memory usage, access to low level vector instructions, and more.\n",
    "- By leveraging packages such as these powered by oneAPI AND keeping libraries up to date, more capability is added to your underlying frameworks so that moving code, especially in a cloud world, can give you ready access to hardware acceleration, in many cases, without having to modify code this vectorized code\n",
    "- Routines are written in C (based on Cython framework)\n",
    "- NumPy arrays are densely packed arrays of homogeneous type. Python lists, by contrast, are arrays of pointers to objects, even when all of them are of the same type. So, you get the benefits of not having to check data types, and you also get locality of reference. Also, many NumPy operations are implemented in C, avoiding the general cost of loops in Python, pointer indirection and per-element dynamic type checking. The speed boost depends on which operations you’re performing. \n",
