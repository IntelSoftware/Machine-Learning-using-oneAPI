    "### Python loops are bad for performance\n",
    "**Python is great!** Its a great  language for AI. There are many, many advantages in using Python especially for data science.\n",
    "- easy to program (dont worry about data types and persnicity syntax at least relative to C/C++ and other languges\n",
    "- FAST for deveoping code!\n",
    "- leverages huge array of libaries to conquer any domain\n",
    "- lots of quick answers to common issues in Stack Exchange\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python, however, is slow for Massively repeating small tasks - such as found in loops! **Python loops are SLOW**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compared to C, C++, Fortran and other typed languages\n",
    "- Python is forced to look up every occurnace and type of variable in a loop to determine what operations it can perform on that data type\n",
    "- It cannot usually take advantage of advances in hardware in terms of vector width increases, multiple cores, new instructions from a new HW instruction set, new AI accelerators, effective amd cache meory layout, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BUT: Python has library remedies to these ills!\n",
    "- Importing key libnraries shift the burden of computation to highly efficient code\n",
    "- Numpy, for example, through its focus on elementwise efficient operations, gives indirect access to the efficiencies afforded in \"C\"  \n",
    "- libraies included in oneAPI and Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn all powered by oneAPI give access to modern advancements in hardware level: access to better cache and memory usage, access to low level vector instructions, and more.\n",
    "- By leveraging packages such as these powered by oneAPI AND keeping libraries up to date, more capability is added to your underlyig frameworks so that moving code, epsecially in a cloud world, can give you ready access to hardware accerlations, in many cases, without having to modify code this vectorized code\n",
    "- Routines are written in C (based on CPython framework)\n",
    "- Numpy arrays are densely packed arrays of homogeneous type. Python lists, by contrast, are arrays of pointers to objects, even when all of them are of the same type. So, you get the benefits of not having to check data types, and you also get locality of reference. Also, many Numpy operations are implemented in C, avoiding the general cost of loops in Python, pointer indirection and per-element dynamic type checking. The speed boost depends on which operations you’re performing. \n",

    "**Goal of this module: Search and destroy (replace) loops**\n",
