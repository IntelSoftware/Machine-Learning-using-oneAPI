Saved Jupyter Notebooks will save sequence numbers which may make a cell appear to have been executed when it has not been executed for the new session. Because state is not saved, re-opening or __restarting a Jupyter Notebook__ will required re-executing all the executable steps, starting in order from the beginning.\n",

    "  * __[ ]__ blank indicates that the cell has not yet been executed.\n",
    "  * __[\\*]__ indicates that the cell is currently executing.\n",
    "  * Once a cell is done executing, a number will appear in the small brackets with each cell execution to indicate where in the sequence the cell has been executed. Any output (e.g. print()'s) from the code will appear below the cell."
