    "\n",
    "This data represent wildlife images taken by the author of thisnotebook. It is an UNBALANCED set of images of Collared Lizards, Pelicans, and Seascapes. The images are shot in various white balances to make clustering a challenge.  Additionally, the data are imbalalanced so that some lizrds were photographed in bright light, and some in shade. The goal is to perform clustering to aid eventual clsasification for use in a CNN semi-supervised learning exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "The iamges are read in from a folder, and one by one that are reshaped to a single row with perhaps 60,000 columns (one image now per row). After they are assembled into a NumPy array there are scaled to zero mean, unit standard deviation to aid the Prinicpal Component step to have somewhat similar scale ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The image array is tranaformed via PCA with 2 to 6 principal components shich changes the shape of the data we feed to kmeans or DBSCAn to n x c where c is the number of principal components we desire (likely in range from 2 to 6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the data is plotted in a Seaborn pairplot to allow us to spot clusters visually, by which ever combo of principal components.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use KMeans or DBSCAN to help automaticllay select which images belong to which cluster as reppresented by the color of the dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also display an image grid of the clustered images to see if simialr images are clustered together to meet with our intuition.\n"
